During aerial LiDAR surveys conducted over the southwestern Amazon, researchers uncovered extensive pre-Columbian settlements near the Llanos de Mojos region. The layout revealed monumental platform mounds, causeways, and water management systems, suggesting a highly organized society. Some earthworks span over 300 meters and are interconnected with canals and road-like structures.

Ethnohistoric accounts from the 16th century mention large populations along the Purus and Madeira rivers, although much of this evidence was previously dismissed due to assumptions of poor agricultural viability in the Amazon. Recent radiocarbon dates place occupation phases between 900 and 1600 CE. 

In the region east of the Tapajós River, satellite and LiDAR imagery show geometric patterns such as circles, squares, and rectangular ditches, likely serving ceremonial or defensive functions. These features are concentrated near elevated terrain and forest clearings, possibly indicating intentional site selection based on strategic visibility and access to water.

Local oral histories from the Xingu and Acre regions also reference “old villages beneath the trees” and stone markers used for rituals, now buried beneath centuries of forest regrowth.
