# 🧭 Amazon Archaeo-AI: Discovering Hidden Archaeological Sites using GPT-4.1 + Satellite Data

![satellite-banner](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Amazon_Sentinel2_image.jpg/640px-Amazon_Sentinel2_image.jpg)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project, submitted for the **OpenAI to Z Challenge**, aims to identify previously unknown archaeological sites within the Amazon biome, focusing on **Northern South America (especially Brazil)**. It combines **GPT-4.1 natural language inference** with **Sentinel-2 satellite analysis (Band 8 – NIR)** to hypothesize and visualize possible areas of past human settlement.

## 🔍 Core Pipeline Components

### 1. 📝 GPT-4.1 Text Inference Engine
- Input: Historical texts (e.g., colonial journals, indigenous oral histories).
- Output: Extracted **directional, spatial, and environmental clues**.
- Capabilities:
  - Infers regions of probable pre-Columbian activity.
  - Generates geospatial hypotheses (with or without coordinates).
  - Formats output as markdown reports.

### 2. 🛰️ Sentinel-2 NIR Anomaly Visualizer
- Uses **Band 8 (Near-Infrared)** imagery to detect:
  - Vegetation stress
  - Earthworks/geoglyphs
  - Buried or altered landscapes
- Saves annotated `.png` visualizations.

### 3. 📚 Validation Using Academic Sources
- Cross-referenced with:
  - [OpenTopography LiDAR](https://opentopography.org/)
  - Peer-reviewed publications (e.g., *Nature*, *Journal of Field Archaeology*)
  - Public repositories (e.g., Internet Archive)

✅ Key Outcomes
Combined large language model inference with remote sensing for archaeological discovery.

Demonstrated how GPT can reason through noisy, historical documents to propose plausible site locations.

Created a scalable, ethical framework for aiding archaeologists and researchers.

📦 Dataset Sources

🧠 Future Enhancements
Integrate LiDAR elevation analysis (e.g., hillshading, canopy modeling)

Add geocoding + GIS shapefile output

Multi-prompt chaining for large document sets

Web dashboard to explore candidate sites interactively

🏁 Why This Matters
With 10,000+ earthworks still undiscovered across the Amazon (Peripato et al., 2023), this project shows how AI + satellite vision can accelerate cultural discovery and protection—ethically and at scale.
